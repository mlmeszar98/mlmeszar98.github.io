                <h2>About</h2>
                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p><span class="pinkb">My name is Madison Meszaros and I am an avid romance book reader!</span> By that I mean I spend a lot of my free time <span class="italic">reading</span> romance books, <span class="italic">buying</span> romance books, <span class="italic">talking</span> about romance books, and <span class="italic">thinking</span> about romance books! You get the idea! The only problem is that I buy books faster than I can read which causes my TBR shelf to grow. In order o combat this problem I have put a hard stop on book buying until I make a serious dent in my TBR shelf. That is where this site comes in handy! </p>
                <h3>What is the goal of this site?</h3>
                <p><span class="pinkb">The goal of this site is to encourage myself and otherto keep get through their TBR.</span> It can be overwhelming seeing your bookshelf overflowing with books you have yet to read and you may not know where to start or if it is even worth it. It is! Once you begin keeping track of your books and current reads it will begin to feel like a game! <span class= "italic">How many books will you get through?</span></p>
                <h3>What is a 'TBR'?</h3>
                <p><span class="pinkb">TBR is a well known acronym in the book reading world which stands for 'to be read'</span>. When you have a list of books sitting on your shelf that you have not read but want to, those are in your 'TBR'. Some people, such as myself, struggle to keep our TBR down to a manageable number.</p><br>
