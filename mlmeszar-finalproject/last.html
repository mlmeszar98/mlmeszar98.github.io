                <h4>Book Description</h4>
                <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year…but not for Maelyn Jones. She's living with her parents, hates her going-nowhere job, and has just made a romantic error of epic proportions.</p>
                <p>But perhaps worst of all, this is the last Christmas Mae will be at her favorite place in the world—the snowy Utah cabin where she and her family have spent every holiday since she was born, along with two other beloved families. Mentally melting down as she drives away from the cabin for the final time, Mae throws out what she thinks is a simple plea to the universe: <span class="italic">Please. Show me what will make me happy.</span></p>
                <p>The next thing she knows, tires screech and metal collides, everything goes black. But when Mae gasps awake…she's on an airplane bound for Utah, where she begins the same holiday all over again. With one hilarious disaster after another sending her back to the plane, Mae must figure out how to break free of the strange time loop—and finally get her true love under the mistletoe.</p>

                <h4>Book Review</h4>
                <p>This book has been sitting on my shelf for at least a year and I finally got to it the other week. This is technically a christmas read, so I'm about two months late. But who is really counting? Christina Laurens utilizes the overdone trope made famous by Groundhog day of reliving a day over and over again, except in this case she relives the entire holiday over and over again. I am a believer that if you are going to use a specific trope like this one then you need to deliver with better results, but this one just doesn't do that. It was filled with cringy one-liners that felt out of place and both the main character and the two love interest were not likeable at all.</p>
                <p>I also feel like reading the same day over and again again is already redundant enough, but reading the same week again and again is just overkill. I understand she probably wanted to write something different from all the other books that use this trope, but a week worth of multiple do-overs is boring to read. It felt like the author needed to write a holiday romance book for their publishing company, but they did not really want to do it.</p>
                <p>I would give this book a <span class="pinkb">2.5/5</span> stars</p><br>
